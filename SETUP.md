# HydraCat Setup Guide

## Phase 1: Project Foundation & Configuration

### ✅ Completed
- [x] Flutter project structure with proper directory organization
- [x] All required dependencies in `pubspec.yaml`
- [x] Basic project structure following recommended architecture
- [x] Firebase service implementation (ready for configuration)
- [x] App structure with Riverpod provider scope
- [x] GoRouter configuration with placeholder screens
- [x] Core constants, exceptions, and utilities
- [x] Updated main.dart to use new app structure
- [x] Fixed Android Gradle configuration
- [x] Updated iOS deployment target to 15.0
- [x] **Verified: Both Android and iOS builds are working!**

### 🔄 Next Steps

#### 1. Firebase Configuration (Required for full functionality)
You need to download and place the Firebase configuration files:

**From your "hydracatTest" project (for development):**
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select "hydracatTest" project
3. Project Settings → Your apps
4. Add Android app with package name: `com.example.hydracat`
5. Add iOS app with bundle ID: `com.example.hydracat`
6. Download both config files

**Place the files:**
- `google-services.json` → `android/app/`
- `GoogleService-Info.plist` → `ios/Runner/`

#### 2. Enable Firebase in the App
After placing the config files:

**Android:**
- Uncomment line in `android/app/build.gradle.kts`:
  ```kotlin
  id("com.google.gms.google-services")
  ```

**App:**
- Uncomment Firebase initialization in `lib/app/app.dart`:
  ```dart
  _initializeFirebase();
  ```

#### 3. Generate Firebase Options
After placing the config files, run:
```bash
flutterfire configure
```
This will generate the proper `firebase_options.dart` file with your actual Firebase configuration.

#### 4. Test the Full Setup
Run the app to ensure everything is working:
```bash
flutter run
```



### 🚀 Current Status
- **✅ Basic app structure**: Working and building successfully
- **✅ Navigation**: GoRouter configured with placeholder screens
- **✅ State management**: Riverpod provider scope ready
- **✅ Core utilities**: Constants, exceptions, and utilities implemented
- **⏳ Firebase**: Ready for configuration files
- **⏳ Authentication**: Placeholder screens ready for implementation

### 🔧 Troubleshooting
- **Firebase initialization errors**: Check that config files are in correct locations
- **Import errors**: Run `flutter pub get` to install dependencies
- **Build errors**: Ensure Firebase CLI is installed and run `flutterfire configure`
- **iOS deployment target**: Already updated to 15.0 for Firebase compatibility

### 📱 Next Phase: Core Architecture Implementation
After Firebase is configured, we'll:
1. Implement authentication system
2. Create data models with Freezed
3. Set up repository pattern
4. Implement core features

---

**Note**: Keep your Firebase project credentials secure and never commit them to version control.

**Current Status**: The app is building successfully on both platforms! Just need Firebase configuration files to enable full functionality.
