After analysing the situation and looking at the relevant code, please come up with the most appropriate plan, following best practices, to fix this issue. Don't try to run the app yourself to test. Just tell me when it's needed and I will run it manually to do the testing myself.

Please ultrathink to come up with the most appropriate plan to achieve this. After analysing the situation and looking at the relevant code, please ask me any question you would need to feel confident about solving the issues. Don't try to run the app yourself to test. Just tell me when it's needed and I will run it manually to do the testing myself.

Please create a detailed plan of how you will achieve and implement this step.
Before you create the plan, please ask any and all questions you have in order to provide the most robust solution to handle edge cases and/or additional context that you might need to feel confident in proceeding with the implementation. When you do use clarifying questions, please do not use bullet points but rather letters within each numbered question if number requires bullet points. Before you ask me questions, please already have a look at all the existing files you would need, as well as previously implemented steps, to already have the context, use existing systems, ensure coherence and in case you already find the answer to your questions. Suggest for each question your recommended solution. Keep in mind that I want to have the best suited solution for my project while being in line with industry standards and app development best practices as much as possible. Please follow Firebase and Flutter best practices and use built-in solutions whenever possible instead of more complex custom solutions. Also, keep in mind the CRUD rules file (.cursor/rules/firebase_CRUDrules.md) to make sure to keep firebase costs to a minimum. Regarding database, I don't need to worry about backward compatibility since I will regularily delete the database anyway for testing.

Please let me know if this makes sense or contradict itself, the prd (prd.md), the CRUD rules or existing code. Coherence and app development best practices are extremely important. Let's me know if you need any more clarifications to feel confident in proceeding with the implementation. Don't try to run the app yourself to test. Just tell me when it's needed and I will run it manually to do the testing myself. After implementation, check for linting issues and, if you found any, fix them.

Please update and add only the important informations to remember about what we implemented in this step for future reference in

Please update logging_plan.md to take into consideration what we just implemented in this step for future reference. Particularily add things we would need to remember for future use or implementation. Keep it as short as possible.


1. a) the pop-up should be its own screen/route that naturally sits above the nav bar. Yes, Flutter's built-in showModalBottomSheet would be great but only if it can sit above the navigation bar so the navigation bar is still visible
2. yes, create a new LoggingPopupWrapper widget. Love the slide-up animation idea.
3. yes, Simple tap-outside or back button dismisses without confirmation (industry standard for quick actions)
Call reset() on dismiss to ensure clean state for next logging session
NO confirmation dialog (adds friction; medications aren't that complex to re-enter). This will be a smooth UX.
4. a) a smaller decision dialog (like ActionSheet on iOS). But of course it needs to respect ui_guidelines.md. b) Two large, tappable buttons (one for medication, one for fluid)
Immediate transition: choice popup dismisses â†’ specific logging popup slides up in the same animation
Store choice in state via setTreatmentChoice() but don't require it for single-treatment personas
5. Uniform 300ms duration for all logging popup animations (consistency)
Blur fade-in: 200ms (fast)
Popup slide-up: 300ms with Curves.easeOutCubic
NO Hero animations for now (adds complexity; FAB and popup are visually distinct). I might add it in the future.
6. this is really an edge case that would concern very few user so I am scared to jump into too much accessibility complexity when the app is still in early developmenent. Let's use this solution, ONLY if this doesn't create too much of code complexity "Add Semantics(modal: true) to the popup wrapper to announce modal state
Add excludeSemantics: true to the blur barrier (it's decorative)
Focus first actionable element (first medication checkbox for meds, volume input for fluids)
Ensure Escape key / back button dismiss is announced"
7. yes, Target max height: 75-80% of screen height
Use LayoutBuilder to detect available space
If content exceeds height, allow minimal scrolling with subtle scroll indicator (being realistic about small phones)
Design for 640px height minimum (iPhone SE size) as baseline
Prioritize showing action buttons even if form is partially scrolled
