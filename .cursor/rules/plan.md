After analysing the situation and looking at the relevant code, please come up with the most appropriate plan, following app development best practices, to fix this issue. Don't try to run the app yourself to test. Just tell me when it's needed and I will run it manually to do the testing myself.

After analysing the situation and looking at the relevant code, please ultrathink to come up with the most appropriate plan to fix this issue. Don't try to run the app yourself to test. Just tell me when it's needed and I will run it manually to do the testing myself.

Please ultrathink to come up with the most appropriate plan, following app development best practices, to achieve this. After analysing the situation and looking at the relevant code, please ask me any question you would need to feel confident about the implementation. Suggest for each question your recommended solution. After implementation, check for linting issues (flutter analyze) and, if you found any, fix them. Don't try to run the app yourself to test. Just tell me when it's needed and I will run it manually to do the testing myself.

Please create a detailed plan of how you will achieve and implement this step. Don't hesitate to let me know if you think of any meaningful and realistic improvements I might have overlooked.
Before you create the plan, please ask any and all questions you have in order to provide the most robust solution to handle edge cases and/or additional context that you might need to feel confident in proceeding with the implementation. When you do use clarifying questions, please do not use bullet points but rather letters within each numbered question if number requires bullet points. Before you ask me questions, please already have a look at all the existing files you would need, as well as previously implemented steps, to already have the context, use existing systems, ensure coherence and in case you already find the answer to your questions. Suggest for each question your recommended solution. Keep in mind that I want to have the best suited solution for my project while being in line with industry standards and app development best practices as much as possible. Please follow Firebase and Flutter best practices and use built-in solutions whenever possible instead of more complex custom/hacky workarounds. Also, keep in mind the CRUD rules file (.cursor/rules/firebase_CRUDrules.md) to make sure to keep firebase costs to a minimum. Regarding database, I don't need to worry about backward compatibility since I will regularily delete the database anyway for testing.

Please let me know if this makes sense or contradict itself, the prd (.cursor/reference/prd.md), the CRUD rules or existing code. Coherence and app development/Flutter best practices are extremely important. Please confirm that this follow industry standards, and if not explain why. Let me know if you need any more clarifications to feel confident in proceeding with the implementation. Don't try to run the app yourself to test. Just tell me when it's needed and I will run it manually to do the testing myself. After implementation, check for linting issues (flutter analyze) and, if you found any, fix them (including the non critical ones). I will test only once we fixed the linting issues.

Please update and add only the important informations to remember about what we implemented in this step for future reference in

## Review prompt example ##
  
I would like to review the code related my ... feature in ... to identify inconsistencies or dead code meaning:
- two different ways of achieving the same thing
- custom solutions when simpler and future-proof Flutter/Dart built-in solutions exist
- dead code (code that isn't actually used anywhere)
- deviance from industry-standards
- documentation reflects actual code
- incoherence with @prd.md @firebase_CRUDrules.md
- wrong use of the file architecture including code present in @core/ 
- useless dependencies when more robust methods could be implemented instead 

Please also use the useful guidelines in @code_review.md to make sure the code is up to my standards.
Basically, I want to make sure the onboarding code is production ready, follow best practices, industry-standards whenever possible so I can share it in the future with a developper team that will understand it easily.
After your careful and detailled analysis, please write your result in ... before we tackle each fix one by one.
I already did something similar in @onboarding_code_review_report.md . I don't need to know how long it would take to fix the issue. I don't need a checklist. Regarding database, I don't need to worry about backward compatibility since I will regularily delete the database manually anyway for testing throughout the development.

Please update logging_plan.md to take into consideration what we just implemented in this step for future reference. Particularily add things we would need to remember for future use or implementation. Don't include information related to linting. Keep it as short as possible.

1. a) Let's allow the users to edit ANY past treatment session. Since it will only be possible from the focused day popup, it will be a very concious decision from the user to navigate to that day and press the edit button.
b) Hide edit buttons for future dates entirely.
2. Allow editing (a) completion status, (b) dosage given, and (d) notes. Do NOT allow changing the date/time in this flow.
3. Allow editing Volume given (with number input, 0-500ml range per existing validation), Injection site, Stress level, Notes field. Do NOT allow changing the date/time in this flow.
If volume is set to zero, leave it as a 0ml session.
4. Individual edit button per session
5. Require explicit "Save" confirmation to prevent accidental edits. Include a "Cancel" button to discard changes. No need for undo toast. No need for explanatory text.
6. a) Allow higher-than-scheduled dosages with no warning.
b) Allow any volume within the validation range (1-500ml) with no additional warnings beyond the model's built-in validation.
c) Yes, queue edits offline using the existing OfflineLoggingService pattern with a new operation type like UpdateMedicationOperation and UpdateFluidOperation.
7. a) Show edit button always on the trailing side of each treatment tile (always visible, no hover required for mobile). We already use such button the the schedule screens.
b) Create a new dedicated edit dialog similar in style but slightly more compact than SessionUpdateDialog since we're editing fewer fields.
c) Keep popup open with updated data.
8. a) Invalidate both weekSessionsProvider(weekStart) and dailyCacheProvider to ensure calendar dots, daily summaries, and popup data all refresh.
b) Yes, use optimistic updates for instant feedback, but revert on error and show an error message.
Can you confirm that we will also update the daily/weekly/monthly summaries accordingly after each edit or would this be too complicated ?
Also, I really like this specific popup UI for the medication dose.
