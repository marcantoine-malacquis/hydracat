Please ultrathink to come up with the most appropriate plan to achieve this. After analysing the situation, please ask me any question you would need to feel confident about solving the issues.

Please create a detailed plan of how you will achieve and implement this step.
Before you create the plan, please ask any and all questions you have in order to provide the most robust solution to handle edge cases and/or additional context that you might need to feel confident in proceeding with the implementation. When you do use clarifying questions, please do not use bullet points but rather letters within each numbered question if number requires bullet points. Before you ask me questions, please already have a look at all the existing files you would need to already have the context, use existing systems, ensure coherence and in case you already find the answer to your questions. Keep in mind that I want to have the best suited solution for my project while being in line with industry standards as much as possible. Also, keep in mind the CRUD rules file to make sure to keep firebase costs to a minimum.

Please let me know if this makes sense or contradict itself, the prd, the CRUD rules or existing code. Coherence is extremely important. Let's me know if you need any more clarifications to feel confident in proceeding with the implementation.

Please update and add only the important informations to remember about what we implemented in this step for future reference in

it will be a very simple navigable list that we will implement later. For now, it stays empty
b) it should be simpler since it's accessed from an already protected screen
6. a) yes, your understanding is correct. NO reads/writes involved in firestore.
b) there will be no future settings that would interact with firebase
Please let me know if this makes sense or contradict itself, the prd, the CRUD rules or existing code. Coherence is extremely important. Let's me know if you need any more clarifications to feel confident in proceeding with the implementation.
