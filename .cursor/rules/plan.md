Please ultrathink to come up with the most appropriate plan to achieve this. After analysing the situation, please ask me any question you would need to feel confident about solving the issues.

Please create a detailed plan of how you will achieve and implement this step.
Before you create the plan, please ask any and all questions you have in order to provide the most robust solution to handle edge cases and/or additional context that you might need to feel confident in proceeding with the implementation. When you do use clarifying questions, please do not use bullet points but rather letters within each numbered question if number requires bullet points. Before you ask me questions, please already have a look at all the existing files you would need to already have the context, use existing systems, ensure coherence and in case you already find the answer to your questions. Keep in mind that I want to have the best suited solution for my project while being in line with industry standards as much as possible. Also, keep in mind the CRUD rules file to make sure to keep firebase costs to a minimum.

Please let me know if this makes sense or contradict itself, the prd, the CRUD rules or existing code. Coherence is extremely important. Let's me know if you need any more clarifications to feel confident in proceeding with the implementation.

Please update and add only the important informations to remember about what we implemented in this step for future reference in 

Don't try to run the app yourself. Just tell me when it's needed and I will run it manually.


1. a) most frequent is by far User State Testing: Fresh user → partial onboarding → completed onboarding
2. Drawer Item in the profile screen
3. I don't need presets, I only want to be able to restart as a fresh experience but using the same authentication and email I've used so far (my own personal email). I want to be able to manually restart a fresh experience with the same account and input another pet, schedule, ... to test stuff.
4. the core data I think. Please keep this to a minimum to achieve what I want (fresh expereience with the same account)
5. Standalone Tool: Independent debug panel with Hot Reload Integration: Works with Flutter hot reload
6. nothing more for now

Does that make sense ? Is this debug panel still the best option to achieve what I want ? (fresh expereience with the same account)
