After analysing the situation and looking at the relevant code, please come up with the most appropriate plan, following app development best practices, to fix this issue. Don't try to run the app yourself to test. Just tell me when it's needed and I will run it manually to do the testing myself.

Please ultrathink to come up with the most appropriate plan to achieve this. After analysing the situation and looking at the relevant code, please ask me any question you would need to feel confident about solving the issues. Don't try to run the app yourself to test. Just tell me when it's needed and I will run it manually to do the testing myself.

Please create a detailed plan of how you will achieve and implement this step.
Before you create the plan, please ask any and all questions you have in order to provide the most robust solution to handle edge cases and/or additional context that you might need to feel confident in proceeding with the implementation. When you do use clarifying questions, please do not use bullet points but rather letters within each numbered question if number requires bullet points. Before you ask me questions, please already have a look at all the existing files you would need, as well as previously implemented steps, to already have the context, use existing systems, ensure coherence and in case you already find the answer to your questions. Suggest for each question your recommended solution. Keep in mind that I want to have the best suited solution for my project while being in line with industry standards and app development best practices as much as possible. Please follow Firebase and Flutter best practices and use built-in solutions whenever possible instead of more complex custom solutions. Also, keep in mind the CRUD rules file (.cursor/rules/firebase_CRUDrules.md) to make sure to keep firebase costs to a minimum. Regarding database, I don't need to worry about backward compatibility since I will regularily delete the database anyway for testing.

Please let me know if this makes sense or contradict itself, the prd (prd.md), the CRUD rules or existing code. Coherence and app development best practices are extremely important. Let me know if you need any more clarifications to feel confident in proceeding with the implementation. Don't try to run the app yourself to test. Just tell me when it's needed and I will run it manually to do the testing myself. After implementation, check for linting issues and, if you found any, fix them. I will test only once we fixed the linting issues.

Please update and add only the important informations to remember about what we implemented in this step for future reference in

Please update logging_plan.md to take into consideration what we just implemented in this step for future reference. Particularily add things we would need to remember for future use or implementation. Keep it as short as possible.


1. yes, Allow editing. Fluid therapy volumes can vary based on the cat's tolerance during the session (e.g., cat got stressed, only managed 80ml of 100ml scheduled).
2. Dropdown selector but no icon needed
3. yes, Segmented control pattern using SegmentedButton (Material 3).
4. yes, never show duplicate warnings (users can log multiple partial sessions). But it would actually be helpful for the user to also have displayed somewhere on the pop-up elegantly when another session was logged that same day. For example: "40mL already administered today".
5. Disabled until volume is valid (1-500ml range)
6. Standard TextField with TextInputType.number (like current implementation)
7. Use the same SuccessIndicator widget as medication logging
8. Use todaysFluidScheduleProvider for pre-filling when available
If null, show empty form with volume input starting at "100" (common default)
Injection site dropdown defaults to first option
Schedule linking will be null (manual log)
9. Separate widget files for reusability.
10. Match medication screen exactly

Yes, let's go with option C Separate info card with subtle styling. 
yes, default to First enum value (FluidLocation.shoulderBladeLeft)
