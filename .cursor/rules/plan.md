After analysing the situation and looking at the relevant code, please come up with the most appropriate plan, following app development best practices, to fix this issue. Don't try to run the app yourself to test. Just tell me when it's needed and I will run it manually to do the testing myself.

Please ultrathink to come up with the most appropriate plan to achieve this. After analysing the situation and looking at the relevant code, please ask me any question you would need to feel confident about solving the issues. Don't try to run the app yourself to test. Just tell me when it's needed and I will run it manually to do the testing myself.

Please create a detailed plan of how you will achieve and implement this step.
Before you create the plan, please ask any and all questions you have in order to provide the most robust solution to handle edge cases and/or additional context that you might need to feel confident in proceeding with the implementation. When you do use clarifying questions, please do not use bullet points but rather letters within each numbered question if number requires bullet points. Before you ask me questions, please already have a look at all the existing files you would need, as well as previously implemented steps, to already have the context, use existing systems, ensure coherence and in case you already find the answer to your questions. Suggest for each question your recommended solution. Keep in mind that I want to have the best suited solution for my project while being in line with industry standards and app development best practices as much as possible. Please follow Firebase and Flutter best practices and use built-in solutions whenever possible instead of more complex custom solutions. Also, keep in mind the CRUD rules file (.cursor/rules/firebase_CRUDrules.md) to make sure to keep firebase costs to a minimum. Regarding database, I don't need to worry about backward compatibility since I will regularily delete the database anyway for testing.

Please let me know if this makes sense or contradict itself, the prd (prd.md), the CRUD rules or existing code. Coherence and app development best practices are extremely important. Let me know if you need any more clarifications to feel confident in proceeding with the implementation. Don't try to run the app yourself to test. Just tell me when it's needed and I will run it manually to do the testing myself. After implementation, check for linting issues (flutter analyze) and, if you found any, fix them. I will test only once we fixed the linting issues.

Please update and add only the important informations to remember about what we implemented in this step for future reference in

Please update logging_plan.md to take into consideration what we just implemented in this step for future reference. Particularily add things we would need to remember for future use or implementation. Don't include information related to linting. Keep it as short as possible.

1. Yes, implement this two-tier approach.
2. Accept this edge case risk and rely on cache warming on app startup to mitigate multi-device issues
3. So I already have this index in Firestore. Is this correct and what you are looking for ?
4. All of the above
5. Options (a) and (c). Create a helper method _getRecentSessionsForDuplicateCheck() that encapsulates the cache-first logic, use it in manual medication logging, and document that offline queue intentionally skips duplicate detection (acceptable since operations are queued with user intent). This keeps the code DRY and maintainable.
6. All of the above
