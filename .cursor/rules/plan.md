After analysing the situation and looking at the relevant code, please come up with the most appropriate plan, following app development best practices, to fix this issue. Don't try to run the app yourself to test. Just tell me when it's needed and I will run it manually to do the testing myself.

After analysing the situation and looking at the relevant code, please ultrathink to come up with the most appropriate plan to fix this issue. Don't try to run the app yourself to test. Just tell me when it's needed and I will run it manually to do the testing myself.

Please ultrathink to come up with the most appropriate plan, following app development best practices, to achieve this. After analysing the situation and looking at the relevant code, please ask me any question you would need to feel confident about the implementation. Suggest for each question your recommended solution. After implementation, check for linting issues (flutter analyze) and, if you found any, fix them. Don't try to run the app yourself to test. Just tell me when it's needed and I will run it manually to do the testing myself.

Please create a detailed plan of how you will achieve and implement this step. Don't hesitate to let me know if you think of any meaningful and realistic improvements I might have overlooked.
Before you create the plan, please ask any and all questions you have in order to provide the most robust solution to handle edge cases and/or additional context that you might need to feel confident in proceeding with the implementation. When you do use clarifying questions, please do not use bullet points but rather letters within each numbered question if number requires bullet points. Before you ask me questions, please already have a look at all the existing files you would need, as well as previously implemented steps, to already have the context, use existing systems, ensure coherence and in case you already find the answer to your questions. Suggest for each question your recommended solution. Keep in mind that I want to have the best suited solution for my project while being in line with industry standards and app development best practices as much as possible. Please follow Firebase and Flutter best practices and use built-in solutions whenever possible instead of more complex custom/hacky workarounds. Also, keep in mind the CRUD rules file (.cursor/rules/firebase_CRUDrules.md) to make sure to keep firebase costs to a minimum. Regarding database, I don't need to worry about backward compatibility since I will regularily delete the database anyway for testing.

Please let me know if this makes sense or contradict itself, the prd (.cursor/reference/prd.md), the CRUD rules (.cursor/rules/firebase_CRUDrules.md) or existing code. Coherence and app development/Flutter best practices are extremely important. Please confirm that this follow industry standards, and if not explain why. Let me know if you need any more clarifications to feel confident in proceeding with the implementation. Don't try to run the app yourself to test. Just tell me when it's needed and I will run it manually to do the testing myself. After implementation, check for linting issues (flutter analyze) and, if you found any, fix them (including the non critical ones). I will test only once we fixed the linting issues.

Please update and add only the important informations to remember about what we implemented in this step for future reference in

## Review prompt example ##
  
I would like to review the code related my ... feature in ... to identify inconsistencies or dead code meaning:
- two different ways of achieving the same thing
- custom solutions when simpler and future-proof Flutter/Dart built-in solutions exist
- dead code (code that isn't actually used anywhere)
- deviance from industry-standards
- documentation reflects actual code
- incoherence with @prd.md @firebase_CRUDrules.md
- wrong use of the file architecture including code present in @core/ 
- useless dependencies when more robust methods could be implemented instead 

Please also use the useful guidelines in @code_review.md to make sure the code is up to my standards.
Basically, I want to make sure the onboarding code is production ready, follow best practices, industry-standards whenever possible so I can share it in the future with a developper team that will understand it easily.
After your careful and detailled analysis, please write your result in ... before we tackle each fix one by one.
I already did something similar in @onboarding_code_review_report.md . I don't need to know how long it would take to fix the issue. I don't need a checklist. Regarding database, I don't need to worry about backward compatibility since I will regularily delete the database manually anyway for testing throughout the development.

1. Yes, Use “number of days where symptom score > 0” per period for each symptom (leveraging existing daily/weekly/monthly summaries)
2. Option 2 = Week view : one bar per day, Month view : one bar per week, year view : one bar per month 
3. Yes, Use a static priority list for now (since you currently have 6 known symptoms) and explicitly keep 5 named symptoms + “Other” ready, but implement the ranking so that when you add more symptoms later the chart naturally switches to “top N + Other” without refactors.
4. Yes, Create a small SymptomColors mapping that reuses the existing pastel hex values from the injection‑sites chart plus one new pastel teal/blue, and use a muted neutral (e.g. textTertiary-tinted) for “Other” to keep it visually de‑emphasized but still distinguishable. We can update @ui_guidelines to include this reusable "palette".
5. In single‑symptom mode, show simple non‑stacked bars in that symptom’s color, hide “Other”, and keep the tooltip minimal (period label + that symptom’s count) for a very clean “advanced user” focus.
6. b) add a short total at the top for quick scanning, then the per‑symptom breakdown, while keeping styling and card shape very close to the existing fluid bar‑chart tooltip (same corner radius, shadow, and arrow behavior)
7. Start with 8 weeks, 12 months, 3 years, using SummaryService’s TTL cache so that once loaded, navigation within that range is almost free from a Firestore perspective and still gives a very comprehensible history.
