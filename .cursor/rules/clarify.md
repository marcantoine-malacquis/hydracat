Please create a detailed plan of how you will achieve and implement this step.
Before you create the plan, please ask any and all questions you have in order to provide the most robust solution to handle edge cases and/or additional context that you might need to feel confident in proceeding with the implementation. When you do use clarifying questions, please do not use bullet points but rather letters within each numbered question if number requires bullet points.

Please let me know if this makes sense or contradict itself or the prd. Let's me know if you need any more clarifications to feel confident in proceeding with the implementation.

Please add only the important informations to remember about what we implemented in this step for future reference in
