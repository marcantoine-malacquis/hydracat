# HydraCAT Quality of Life (QoL) – Scientific & Clinical Basis

## Purpose and Scope
HydraCAT QoL is a **research‑informed, owner‑reported quality of life tracking instrument** designed specifically for cats with chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Its purpose is **longitudinal monitoring within the same cat over time**, not diagnosis, prognosis, or clinical decision‑making in isolation.

> ⚠️ This tool is **not a diagnostic instrument** and does not replace veterinary assessment.

## Why Quality of Life Tracking Matters in Feline CKD

CKD is a chronic, progressive condition in which:
- Clinical signs fluctuate over weeks to months
- Owners often normalize slow decline
- Laboratory changes lag behind functional and behavioral changes

Owner‑observed QoL trends can therefore:
- Detect early deterioration
- Support treatment adjustments
- Improve communication with veterinarians
- Reduce caregiver distress and decisional conflict

---

## Measurement Approach

### Instrument Type
- **Owner‑reported outcome measure (OROM)**
- Behavioral and functional observations only
- Short recall period to balance signal and burden

### Intended Use
- Track **changes relative to the cat’s own baseline**
- Compare trends before/after treatment changes
- Support (not replace) clinical discussions

---

## Domain Model (5 Domains)

The HydraCAT QoL model uses five equally weighted domains, chosen for relevance to feline CKD and owner observability.

### 1. Vitality
Observable energy, activity, and engagement with the environment.

### 2. Comfort
Physical comfort related to mobility, posture, rest, and litterbox use.

### 3. Emotional & Social Wellbeing
Observable affect and social behaviors (interaction, hiding, responsiveness).

### 4. Appetite & Enjoyment of Food
Interest in food, willingness to eat, and enjoyment rather than caloric adequacy.

### 5. Treatment Burden
Stress and disruption related to medications, fluids, handling, and care routines.

> Domains are **not diagnostic categories** and may be influenced by multiple underlying factors.

---

## Recall Period

All questions refer to the **previous 7 days**.

This window:
- Smooths day‑to‑day variability
- Matches common veterinary follow‑up rhythms
- Improves reliability for owner recall

---

## Scoring Philosophy

### Item Scoring
- Each item scored on a **0–4 scale**
- Higher scores always indicate **better quality of life**
- Some items are reverse‑scored internally, but this is invisible to the user

### Domain Scores
- Domain score = mean of answered items within that domain
- Items marked **“Not sure / unable to observe”** are excluded from calculation

### Overall QoL Score
- Overall score = mean of the five domain scores
- Domains are **equally weighted**

> Equal weighting is used for transparency and to avoid unvalidated assumptions about domain importance.

---

## Interpretation Principles

### Trend Over Absolute Value
QoL scores are most meaningful when:
- Compared to the cat’s own previous scores
- Interpreted over time rather than as single snapshots

Absolute score bands (e.g., “Good”, “Fair”) are **tracking labels**, not clinical grades.

### Non‑Specificity
A change in QoL reflects a **change in lived experience**, not a specific disease mechanism.

Low scores **do not imply**:
- A specific diagnosis (e.g., anemia, uremia)
- Disease stage
- Prognosis

---

## Safety and Ethical Framing

HydraCAT QoL:
- Avoids diagnostic language
- Does not provide medical advice
- Does not trigger emergency instructions based on score alone

Red‑flag education (e.g., not eating for 24h, repeated vomiting, collapse) should be provided **separately from QoL scoring**.

---

## Validation Roadmap (Planned)

### 1. Reliability
- Internal consistency (Cronbach’s α) per domain
- Test–retest reliability in stable cats

### 2. Construct Validity
- Known‑groups comparison (e.g., IRIS stage, appetite status)
- Convergent validity with clinical indicators where available

### 3. Responsiveness
- Sensitivity to change following treatment adjustments

### 4. MCID (Exploratory)
- Estimation of minimum clinically important difference for longitudinal change

---

## Summary

HydraCAT QoL is designed as a **practical, ethically framed, and scientifically grounded tracking tool** that prioritizes:
- Owner usability
- Longitudinal insight
- Veterinary collaboration

It intentionally favors **clarity, transparency, and trend detection** over false precision.
