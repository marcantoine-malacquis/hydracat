flutter_native_splash:
  # This package generates native code to customize Flutter's default white native splash screen
  # with background color and splash image.
  # Steps to make this work:
  # 1. Customize the parameters below.
  # 2. run the following command in the terminal:
  # dart run flutter_native_splash:create
  # 3. voila, done!

  # NOTES:
  # - in case you got some trouble, cleaning up flutter project might help:
  # flutter clean ; flutter pub get
  # - To restore Flutter's default white splash screen, run the following command in the terminal:
  # dart run flutter_native_splash:remove

  # IMPORTANT NOTE: These parameter do not affect the configuration of Android 12 and later, which
  # handle splash screens differently that prior versions of Android.  Android 12 and later must be
  # configured specifically in the android_12 section below, at the very end.

  #======================================================================
  
  # FOR ALL PLATFORM, except Android 12+:

  # General color for all platform (except android 12+):
  color: "#F6F4F2"  # AppColors.background - warm off-white
  color_dark: "#1A1A1A"  # AppColors.darkBackground

  # General image for all platform (except android 12+):
  # allows you to specify an image used in the splash screen. It must be a
  # png file and should be sized for 4x pixel density.

  # Image alignment (default center if not specified):
  # android_gravity: center
  # ios_content_mode: center
  # web_image_mode: center

  # Hide notification bar on android. ios already hides it by default. 
  # Has no effect in web since web has no notification bar.
  fullscreen: true

  #======================================================================
  
  # Android 12+ configuration (API 31+)
