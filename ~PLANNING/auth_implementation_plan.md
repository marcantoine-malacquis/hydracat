# HydraCat Authentication Implementation Plan (Hybrid Approach)

## Overview
Implement Firebase Authentication with a beginner-friendly hybrid approach that provides immediate visual feedback while building solid foundations. Start with core models, minimal services, and one working screen, then expand systematically.

## Key Authentication Requirements Summary

### Authentication Methods
- **Email/Password**: Standard registration and login with Firebase Auth
- **Social Sign-In**: Google Sign-In (both platforms) and Apple Sign-In (iOS only)
- **Password Recovery**: Standard Firebase password reset functionality

### Email Verification Strategy ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
- **Manual sending**: Users control when verification emails are sent via dedicated screen
- **Non-blocking**: Users can access core features while unverified
- **Feature gating**: Premium/sensitive features require verified email
- **Dedicated verification screen**: Clear, focused experience with automatic status checking

### User Experience Flow
- **Mandatory authentication**: All users must sign in to use the app
- **Free tier default**: New users automatically start as free tier
- **Progressive onboarding**: Pet setup happens after authentication, not during
- **App exploration**: Users can navigate the app without pet profile initially

### Feature Access Control
**Unverified Users Can Access:**
- Core medical features: Fluid logging, reminders, basic streak tracking
- Essential functionality: Scheduling, session history, offline logging
- Basic analytics: Simple streak counts and adherence metrics

**Unverified Users Cannot Access:**
- Premium features: PDF exports, advanced analytics, detailed reports
- Costly operations: Complex Cloud Function triggers, heavy Firestore queries
- Subscription content: Premium-only insights and recommendations

### Security & Cost Control
- **Rate limiting**: Prevent spam account creation and brute force attacks
- **Cost protection**: Expensive operations gated behind email verification
- **Data security**: Secure token storage, proper session management
- **Privacy compliance**: GDPR-compliant data handling and user control

### Offline & Reliability Requirements
- **Critical feature availability**: Core medical functions always work offline
- **Auth state persistence**: Users stay logged in across app restarts
- **Never block medical data**: Authentication issues never prevent access to logged data
- **Sync on reconnection**: Automatic data synchronization when coming back online

### Platform & Technical Requirements
- **Development focus**: Firebase development environment initially
- **Cross-platform**: iOS (15.0+) and Android (API 21+) support
- **State management**: Integration with Riverpod providers (auth, sync, analytics)
- **Router integration**: Reactive navigation based on authentication state

## ⚠️ Common Issue: Google Sign-In Crashes in Production

### Problem Description
Google Sign-In works perfectly in development flavor but crashes when pressing the Google Sign-In button in production builds with this error:
```
GoogleSignIn framework crash in -[GIDSignIn signInWithOptions:]
Bundle ID mismatch or Firebase configuration issue
```

### Root Cause
The Firebase setup script runs correctly but copies the GoogleService-Info.plist to the wrong location. The Xcode Resources build phase overwrites the environment-specific configuration file with the default development config, causing production builds to use the wrong Firebase project credentials.

### Solution
**File:** `ios/Runner/firebase_setup.sh`

**Change the destination path from:**
```bash
DEST_FILE="${BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR}/${PRODUCT_NAME}.app/GoogleService-Info.plist"
```

**To:**
```bash
DEST_FILE="${SRCROOT}/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist"
```

**Why this works:**
- Script runs during build phase BEFORE Resources phase
- Copies the correct environment-specific plist to Runner directory  
- Resources build phase then includes the correct file in final app bundle
- Production builds get `myckdapp` project, development gets `hydracattest` project

### Verification
1. **Development:** `flutter run --flavor development -t lib/main_development.dart`
   - Should use bundle ID: `com.example.hydracatTest`
   - Should connect to Firebase project: `hydracattest`

2. **Production:** `flutter run --flavor production -t lib/main_production.dart`  
   - Should use bundle ID: `com.example.hydracat`
   - Should connect to Firebase project: `myckdapp`
   - Google Sign-In should work without crashes

### Prevention
Always ensure the Firebase setup script copies environment-specific config files to a location that will be processed correctly by the Resources build phase, not directly to the final app bundle location.

## ✅ Feature Gating System - Implementation Complete

### Overview
A flexible feature gating system that restricts premium features to verified users while keeping core medical functionality always accessible. The system provides three widget patterns for different UX approaches and centralized feature access control.

### Core Components

**1. FeatureGateService (`lib/shared/services/feature_gate_service.dart`)**
- Centralized feature access checking based on email verification
- Predefined feature categories (free vs verified-only)
- User-friendly blocking reason messages
- Simple boolean checks: `FeatureGateService.canAccessFeature('feature_id')`

**2. Verification Gate Widgets (`lib/shared/widgets/verification_gate.dart`)**
- **VerificationGate**: Shows upgrade prompt when feature is blocked
- **VerificationGateHidden**: Completely hides premium features from unverified users  
- **VerificationGateDisabled**: Shows disabled state with dialog explanation

### Usage Guidelines

#### Adding New Premium Features
1. **Add feature ID** to `verifiedOnlyFeatures` list in `FeatureGateService`
2. **Wrap the feature UI** with appropriate gate widget:
```dart
// Shows upgrade prompt when blocked
VerificationGate(
  featureId: 'pdf_export',
  child: PremiumButton(),
)

// Hides feature completely when blocked
VerificationGateHidden(
  featureId: 'advanced_analytics', 
  child: AnalyticsWidget(),
)

// Shows disabled state when blocked
VerificationGateDisabled(
  featureId: 'cloud_backup',
  onTap: () => performBackup(),
  child: BackupButton(),
)
```

#### Feature Categories
> **📝 Note:** These feature lists are defined in `lib/shared/services/feature_gate_service.dart` - modify them there when adding/changing features.

**Free Features (Always Accessible):**
- `fluid_logging` - Core medical logging
- `reminders` - Treatment reminders
- `basic_streak_tracking` - Simple adherence tracking
- `session_history` - Historical data viewing
- `offline_logging` - Offline data entry
- `basic_analytics` - Simple metrics

**Premium Features (Verification Required):**
- `pdf_export` - PDF report generation
- `advanced_analytics` - Detailed analytics
- `detailed_reports` - Comprehensive reports
- `cloud_sync_premium` - Advanced cloud features
- `export_data` - Data export functionality
- `premium_insights` - AI-powered insights

#### Implementation Patterns
**For new premium screens:**
```dart
class PremiumScreen extends ConsumerWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context, WidgetRef ref) {
    return VerificationGate(
      featureId: 'premium_feature_id',
      child: ActualScreenContent(),
    );
  }
}
```

**For premium sections within screens:**
```dart
// Hide premium sections
VerificationGateHidden(
  featureId: 'advanced_charts',
  child: AdvancedChartsSection(),
)
```

**For premium actions:**
```dart
FloatingActionButton(
  onPressed: FeatureGateService.canAccessFeature('export_pdf')
    ? () => exportPdf()
    : () => showVerificationDialog(),
  child: Icon(Icons.picture_as_pdf),
)
```

### Design Principles
1. **Medical Safety First**: Core health features never blocked
2. **Cost Control**: Expensive operations require verification
3. **Progressive Enhancement**: Features unlock with verification
4. **Clear Messaging**: Users understand why features are limited
5. **Easy Integration**: Simple widget wrapping, minimal code changes

### Verification Status Display
Users can check their verification status in the **Profile screen**, which shows:
- Current verification state with visual indicators
- Direct link to email verification process
- Clear explanation of verification benefits
