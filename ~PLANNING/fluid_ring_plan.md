a ring on the progress screen to have at a glance how much fluid was given this week/month
(using weekly/monthly fluid summary ?)

Ring behavior: Smooth fill toward the goal; subtle haptic at 100%; never red for “behind.”
Inside of the ring : 
row one : big number (400), small font (mL)
row two : weekly target in small font (/1000mL) - how do we get this number : calculated from schedule collection or from a new parameter in the weekly/monthly summary collection ?

Complete state "Beautiful consistency."
