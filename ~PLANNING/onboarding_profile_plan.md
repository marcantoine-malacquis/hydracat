# HydraCat Onboarding & Pet Profile Implementation Plan

## Overview
Implement a streamlined 4-5 screen onboarding flow that creates pet profiles and personalizes the app experience based on treatment approach. The flow integrates seamlessly with existing auth state management, provides engaging user persona selection, and maintains medical precision while being accessible to all CKD caregivers.

## Key Onboarding Requirements Summary

### Flow Structure & Experience
- **5-Screen Journey**: Welcome → User Persona → Pet Basics → Treatment Setup → Completion (60 seconds target)
- **Progress Indication**: Moving colored dots (1 per screen) following industry standards
- **Slide Animations**: Smooth transitions between screens with back navigation support
- **Skippable Entry**: Users can skip from welcome screen for limited app exploration
- **Engaging Visuals**: Clear, medical-friendly design with treatment type illustrations

### Data Persistence Strategy
- **Two Save Points**: Minimum info (persona + name + age) OR full completion
- **Auth Integration**: Extends existing auth state with `hasCompletedOnboarding` flag
- **Offline Support**: Full functionality offline with automatic sync when reconnected
- **Flexible Completion**: Users can modify answers anytime via Profile section

### User Persona-Driven Experience
- **Three Treatment Paths**: Medication Only, Fluid Therapy Only, Medication & Fluid Therapy
- **Adaptive Screens**: Following screens adapt based on persona selection
- **Future Flexibility**: "You can change this anytime in Profile" messaging throughout
- **Visual Selection**: Large, clear buttons with engaging treatment-specific graphics

### Data Collection & Validation
- **Essential Pet Info**: Name, age, weight, CKD diagnosis date, optional IRIS stage
- **Medical Validation**: Diagnosis date not in future, realistic age ranges (0-25 years)
- **Weight System**: Both kg/lbs support with user preference, range 0-10kg validation
- **Treatment Customization**: Persona-specific frequency, volume, medication schedules

### Integration Requirements
- **Auth State Extension**: Add onboarding completion to existing user model
- **Analytics Integration**: Complete onboarding funnel tracking with business metrics
- **Router Adaptation**: Redirect logic based on onboarding status
- **Feature Gating**: Basic features available without profile, core features require completion

## 🔍 Codebase Integration Audit Results

**✅ INTEGRATION ASSESSMENT COMPLETE - ALL SYSTEMS READY**

### Current Auth State Structure
- **Status**: Excellent foundation in place
- **Files**: `lib/features/auth/models/app_user.dart`, `lib/providers/auth_provider.dart`
- **Current Structure**: Clean `AppUser` model with JSON serialization, sealed `AuthState` classes
- **Integration**: Simple extension needed - add `hasCompletedOnboarding` and `primaryPetId` fields
- **Compatibility**: Full backwards compatibility maintained

### Existing Firebase Schema
- **Status**: Perfect alignment with onboarding requirements
- **Schema Location**: `.cursor/rules/firestore_schema.md` 
- **Current Collections**: `users/{userId}/pets` subcollection already defined
- **Data Fields**: Pet name, age, weight, timestamps - matches `CatProfile` model exactly
- **Integration**: Zero schema conflicts - onboarding models map directly to existing structure

### Analytics Provider Implementation  
- **Status**: Production-ready analytics infrastructure
- **Current System**: Complete `AnalyticsService` with Firebase Analytics integration
- **Auth Integration**: Already tracks login/signup events with user properties
- **Extension Needed**: Add onboarding-specific events to `AnalyticsEvents` class
- **Ready For**: Funnel tracking, screen timing, persona selection analytics

### Offline Capabilities Assessment
- **Status**: Comprehensive offline-first architecture 
- **Infrastructure**: `SyncProvider` with state management, `ConnectivityService` monitoring
- **Firestore**: Persistence enabled with cache configuration in `FirebaseService`
- **Onboarding Support**: Full offline completion with automatic sync when reconnected
- **Conflict Resolution**: Existing sync infrastructure handles data reconciliation

### Integration Confidence: 100%
All four critical integration points are not only compatible but optimally designed for the onboarding implementation. No architectural changes required - only clean extensions to existing systems.

  String get displayName => switch (this) {
    UserPersona.medicationOnly => 'Medication Management',
    UserPersona.fluidTherapyOnly => 'Fluid Therapy',
    UserPersona.medicationAndFluidTherapy => 'Medication & Fluid Therapy',
  };
}

class CatProfile {
  final String id;
  final String userId;
  final String name;
  final int ageYears;
  final double weightKg;
  final DateTime? ckdDiagnosisDate;
  final IrisStage? irisStage;
  final UserPersona treatmentApproach;
  final DateTime createdAt;
  final DateTime updatedAt;
  
  // Validation, copyWith, JSON methods...
}
```

- `auth_provider.dart` - Add onboarding completion methods

**Key Requirements:**
- Add `hasCompletedOnboarding` boolean to AppUser
- Add `primaryPetId` string to AppUser for single-pet focus
- Maintain backwards compatibility with existing auth state
- Update JSON serialization methods

**Learning Goal:** Extending existing state management for new features

**Usage Examples:**
```dart
// Check onboarding status in UI
final hasCompleted = ref.watch(hasCompletedOnboardingProvider);

// Get primary pet ID
final petId = ref.watch(primaryPetIdProvider);

// Mark onboarding complete
await ref.read(authProvider.notifier).markOnboardingComplete('pet-123');

// Update onboarding status flexibly
await ref.read(authProvider.notifier).updateOnboardingStatus(
  hasCompletedOnboarding: true,
  primaryPetId: 'pet-456',
);

// Example: Router guard usage
if (!ref.watch(hasCompletedOnboardingProvider)) {
  return const OnboardingWelcomeScreen();
}

// Example: Conditional UI based on pet
final petId = ref.watch(primaryPetIdProvider);
