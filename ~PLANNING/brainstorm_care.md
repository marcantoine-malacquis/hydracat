Replace “streaks” with “care milestones.”
e.g., “You’ve logged care for 20 days — that’s wonderful dedication!”
→ Focus on total care rather than perfect streaks.

- Gentle reminders instead of loss aversion. Instead of “You lost your streak,” say “No log today? Remember to update when you can 💛.”
- Avoid numerical perfection (e.g., “10 days in a row” → “10 days of care logged”).
- Flexible tracking: Allow owners to log retroactively or mark days as “no treatment needed.”
- Positive framing: Highlight care quality and compassion over quantity — “You’re doing an amazing job supporting Muffin’s health.”
- Use warm, affirming language that celebrates compassion, not compliance.
    ✅ “Your dedication is making a difference.”
    🚫 “You completed 80% of treatments this month.”


Home screen :
 Small banner
 paw prints filling up instead of numbers:
A paw horizontal for each week, that fills according to how the week is going. 5 paws total (except for Februaries that start on a Monday (4 paws))


Progress screen :
 Add a “Milestones” summary panel below or next to calendar:
 “💖 50 total care days logged”
 “🌼 10 full weeks of treatment completed”
 “🕊️ 1 month since diagnosis — thank you for being there for her.”
Include a timeline or journey visualization: a simple horizontal progress bar or timeline with icons at milestones (pawprints, hearts, drops, etc.).
UX benefits:
This screen becomes the emotional anchor — a place to see the long-term journey.
Encourages reflection without daily pressure.
You can add an optional “Share with vet” or “Download report” feature here for clinical collaboration.
