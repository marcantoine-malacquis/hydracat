Replace “streaks” with “care milestones.”

# Positive/Caring Language

e.g., “You’ve logged care for 20 days — that’s wonderful dedication!”
Never use "missed" or "lost" language (we will also need to change wherever it is used in the app UI):
❌ "You missed 2 days this week"
✅ "You logged care 5 times this week - wonderful job!"
❌ "Don't lose your streak!"
✅ "Log today's care when you're ready 💙"

→ Focus on total care rather than perfect streaks.

We could also track :
- Journey milestones: Time-based (1 week, 1 month, 3 months since
  diagnosis)
- Consistency milestones: Weekly care patterns (but framed positively : "5 wonderful weeks of consistent care")
- Quality milestones: Complete logs with notes, stress levels tracked, etc.
- Learning milestones: Read educational content, tried new techniques

# Forgiving Window System

- Gentle reminders instead of loss aversion. Instead of “You lost your streak,” say “No log today? Remember to update when you can 💛.”
- Weekly view: Focus on overall week rather than daily perfection
- Flexible tracking: Allow owners to log retroactively or mark days as “no treatment needed.”
- Positive framing: Highlight care quality and compassion over quantity — “You’re doing an amazing job supporting Muffin’s health.”
- Use warm, affirming language that celebrates compassion, not compliance.
    ✅ “Your dedication is making a difference.”
    🚫 “You completed 80% of treatments this month.”


# Home screen 

 Small banner
 paw prints filling up instead of numbers:
Current Week: [🐾][🐾][🐾][🐾][⚪]
              Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun
🌼 Last logged: Today, 2:30 PM

A paw horizontal for each day (7 paws total), that get filled according to how the day is going (all treatment logged that day -> corresponding paw gets fully filled). 

Alternative : something like a plant/tree (Starts as a small sprout, Grows with each care entr, Blooms at milestones, Doesn't wilt if you miss a day, just grows slower)

# Progress screen

 Add a “Milestones” summary panel above the calendar:
 “💖 50 total care days logged”
 “🌼 10 full weeks of treatment completed”
 “🕊️ 1 month since diagnosis — thank you for being there for her.”

Include a timeline or journey visualization: a simple horizontal progress bar or timeline with icons at milestones (pawprints, hearts, drops, etc.).

UX benefits:
This screen becomes the emotional anchor — a place to see the long-term journey.
Encourages reflection without daily pressure.
You can add an optional “Share with vet” or “Download report” feature here for clinical collaboration.

Milestones : first day, first week, first month

# Smart Notification Strategy

Reminders should be supportive, not nagging
Never send: "You're about to lose your streak!" or "You missed
yesterday"

# Balance checklist

✅ Guilt-free gaps: Missing 2-3 days doesn't feel like failure
✅ Multiple wins: Always something positive to celebrate
✅ No loss language: Nothing is ever "lost" or "broken"
✅ Flexible logging: Can catch up without penalty
✅ Health-first: Medical needs trump gamification
✅ Warm tone: Feels supportive, not demanding
✅ Long-term view: Celebrates journey, not perfection
