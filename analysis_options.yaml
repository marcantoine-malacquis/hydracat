# This file configures the analyzer, which statically analyzes Dart code to
# check for errors, warnings, and lints.
#
# The issues identified by the analyzer are surfaced in the UI of Dart-enabled
# IDEs (https://dart.dev/tools#ides-and-editors). The analyzer can also be
# invoked from the command line by running `flutter analyze`.

# Switch to Very Good Analysis rules for stricter linting
include: package:very_good_analysis/analysis_options.yaml

# You can customize or relax rules below if needed.
